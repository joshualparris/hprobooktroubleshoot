# Windows Crash Doctor — 100-item upgrade roadmap

This is the canonical product backlog derived from a September 2026 comparison against ten mature crash, hang and system-diagnostics tools.

**Status:** all items below are intentionally unchecked. Completing an item requires implementation **and** a regression/acceptance test.  
**Priorities:** `P0` = core diagnostic reliability, `P1` = high-value expansion, `P2` = advanced/productisation.  
**Evidence rule:** new automation must preserve the current rule that observation, interpretation and causality are separate concepts.

## Definition of done

A roadmap item is not complete until it has:
1. a documented input/output contract;
2. explicit privacy and privilege behaviour;
3. a Windows regression test or fixture where practical;
4. bounded failure behaviour when evidence is unavailable;
5. documentation in `windows-crash-doctor/README.md`;
6. no automatic high-risk remediation without explicit user approval.

## Delivery order

Rather than implementing all 100 in numerical order:

- **Phase A — make evidence richer:** dump parsing/symbols, WER ingestion, ETW circular capture, incident catalogue and retention.
- **Phase B — make conclusions stronger:** stack analysis, bugcheck knowledge, deduplication, historical correlation and package/driver identity.
- **Phase C — make capture proactive:** ProcDump-style triggers, automated crash detection, boot/resume traces and runtime hooks.
- **Phase D — make investigation usable:** timeline UI, report history, privacy review, remote/offline workflows and guided support export.
- **Phase E — make it extensible:** plugins, custom profiles, reporting backends, retracing and debugger integrations.

The ProBook remains the first golden regression case, but no generic rule may assume HP-specific facts unless a profile explicitly supplies them.
